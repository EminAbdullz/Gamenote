				"Modern gaming laptops combine high performance and mobility. Also, gaming models are often equipped with special gaming keyboards with protection against accidental clicks, good acoustics and high-quality displays.",
				"How to find game model?",
				"To find out whether the laptop you have chosen is really a gaming model, you should study the information on its manufacturer's website: usually they clearly and clearly write what the model is intended for. Gaming laptop models are available from all manufacturers.",
				"It is easier to recognize the game model with the presence of a discrete gaming video card (in other words, GPU): for example, NVIDIA has a GeForce RTX. GeForce MX graphics are not suitable for gaming.",
				"The appearance of the gaming laptop is also usually different, usually it has an aggressive design, bright RGB lighting of the keyboard and other elements. There are also gaming models decorated in a restrained style, but we have not yet encountered the opposite in stores.",

				"Before choosing a gaming laptop, you need to know exactly what you will be playing. The comfort of the game and, accordingly, the number of your winnings depends on the requirements of the game and the performance of the video card.",
				"The main indicator of performance in games is FPS, or the number of frames per second produced by the video card. The higher the FPS, the more responsive the controls and the smoother the game will appear on the screen. This allows the player to react earlier to the actions of opponents and gain an important advantage for victory. A standard 60 FPS is required for normal games, and 120 or higher for eSports. The number of FPS depends on the performance of the discrete graphics card.",
				"The more frames the video card produces, the higher the chances of winning. So, it is better to choose a model with a more productive GPU."

				"High FPS reduces latency (up to 15 ms and below) and provides an advantage in competitive and eSports games - the screenshot shows the difference in the spread in hitting the target. The smaller the spread, the more accurately the player can shoot.",
				"NVIDIA Reflex technology will help make controls as responsive as possible in competitive games. This technology further reduces latency by eliminating buffering at various stages of the game. Reflex is enabled in the game settings and allows you to improve control in more than 20 competitive games on NVIDIA graphics cards."

GeForce Experience (GFE) software automatically optimizes games with laptop configurations for the best possible visuals at 60 FPS. GFE also allows you to optimize all popular photo, video and graphics applications with one click.",

				"I definitely recommend reading user reviews on the models you're interested in before making a purchase. Every non-replaceable part of the laptop - display, keyboard, video card, and if you don't want to use headphones every time, including sound, you need to check user and professional reviews.",
				"The problem with laptop screens is low brightness and small color gamut. It is better to choose displays with at least 90% sRGB color gamut and 250+ cd/sq brightness. If the display supports NVIDIA G-Sync technology: it will provide a smoother game play without gaps and jarring videos.",
				"There can be many issues with keyboards, including odd key placement, poor quality mechanisms, and generally poor construction. These should be checked and tested while buying or reading reviews.",
				"It is very important to learn what they say about the cooling system (CO) in reviews and descriptions.

				"What are the features of a gaming laptop?",
				"Users often worry that the laptop makes a lot of noise and heats up during operation. This is normal as long as nothing slows down in games. The fact is that an average gaming laptop emits up to 150 watts of heat during operation. Radiators are usually relatively compact: to dissipate heat effectively, they must pass large volumes of air through them, and the vanes must operate at high speeds.",
				"Another common question is whether it is possible to play on battery power or whether it is necessary to connect the laptop to electricity. Most gaming laptops perform drastically without external power, so you can play at full performance with just power from a wall outlet.",
				"NVIDIA has a special Battery Boost technology that allows you to increase the battery life up to twice at the cost of low graphics quality and limit the maximum number of frames. This will be useful to ensure that the laptop can work with the battery for more than an hour. Enable DLSS 2.0 in games that support this technology (more than 170 games) with a GeForce RTX card, and it will increase battery life by about 20%."

				"The best video cards for video editing in 2022",
				"Previously, video editing software used only the central processing unit (CPU) to process and export videos. But even CPUs with four, six, eight or more cores can't compete with the sheer processing power of graphics cards with thousands of compute units.",
				"In this article, we'll cover the best graphics cards for video editing with smooth, proxy-free previews, fast rendering, faster encoding, and smart AI-powered tools.",
				"Even entry-level graphics cards will speed up your workflow and save you time. We recommend choosing the card that best suits your performance and price requirements. Well, to make your choice easier, we will talk about the best models and their features.",
				"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti",
				"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 is currently the best card for performing editing of any complexity. The RTX 3090 is equipped with 24GB of GDDR6X memory with a throughput of 936GB/s, which allows you to work on the most complex projects at resolutions up to 8K. A large-capacity video memory card will help you play 8K video smoothly in the display window and display 8K projects quickly. A large amount of video memory, as well as the maximum performance of this flagship card in practice, means that it can easily cope with all tasks.",
				"Although the performance increase is not that great compared to the more affordable RTX 3080, the versatility of the RTX 3090 makes this card a great choice for demanding professionals.",
				"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti",
				"If you're looking for the best price/performance card, then look no further than NVIDIA's RTX 3060 Ti.",
				"This graphics card will provide very decent performance in projects up to 6K resolution. Like the rest of the RTX cards in the series, the 3060 Ti will accelerate AI tools such as automatic framing and masks. These tools will save you a lot of time when adapting videos to smartphone screens, as well as selecting and tracking objects.",
				"The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti will suit the widest possible range of users, such as students, hobbyists, freelancers and broadcasters. There are many variants of this card from different manufacturers, many of which are overclocked",
				"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050",
				"If you're on a tight budget, then take a look at the GeForce RTX 3050.",
				"Video export and rendering speeds will be 20 - 40% slower than previous cards in the series, but the RTX 3050 is cheaper, so that makes it a great choice. The card cannot boast of a record amount of video memory, but 8 gigabytes of GDDR6 is enough to comfortably work with video with a resolution of up to 6K. Plus, the RTX 3050 gives you full access to all RTX features - accelerated rendering, encoding and AI tools.",

				"NVIDIA RTX A4000",
				"NVIDIA offers not only a wide range of GeForce graphics cards, but also professional NVIDIA RTX cards. If GeForce is mainly promoted for games and creativity, NVIDIA RTX solutions are more intended for corporate and professional use. This is noticeable in the large amount of video memory and corporate services available only for these cards.",
				"The hardware specification of the NVIDIA RTX A4000 graphics card is almost the same as the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, which is 40% cheaper than the A4000.",
				"So why pay more for NVIDIA RTX? First, the RTX A4000 has twice as much video memory, which will allow it to be successfully used for heavy 8K projects. Second, corporate technical support, available 24 hours a day, will help you quickly when a problem arises. In addition, cards aimed at the corporate segment have virtualization support and other bonuses that will be useful for company professionals and IT specialists.",
				"How to choose a video card?",
				"If you're editing video on a Windows PC, you have a lot of options when it comes to choosing a graphics card. Almost any NVIDIA graphics card will work fine as long as your computer meets the following requirements:",
				"1. Make sure your computer case has enough space. Many high-end graphics cards are quite large, so they can take up too much space both in the case and lengthwise, causing the card to not fit in with other components. Also, cards with bulky heatsinks may require more space directly below the PCI Express slot.",
				"2. Verify that your computer's power supply unit (PSU) meets the card's power requirements. Installing a power-hungry video card can overload a weak PSU, causing the system to shut down. A card like the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti requires 200 W of power, so a 600 W block should be enough to power the entire computer. Recommended power requirements are always given on the graphics card manufacturer's product specification pages. You should also check that the PSU has the correct number of spare power connectors of the correct type to connect the card.",
				"3. Make sure your PC motherboard is compatible. Video cards use the PCI Express 16x connector since ancient times (more than 10 years), so if your motherboard is not completely covered with moss, you can easily connect a modern video card to your computer."
